# 📚 BookVill — Read Everything. All in One Place.

> Novels · Manga · Manhwa · Manhua · Comics · Light Novels

---

## 🔍 What Problem Are We Solving?

Readers today are **scattered across dozens of platforms** just to enjoy different formats:
- **Novels** → Kindle, Wattpad, Royal Road
- **Manga** → MangaDex, MangaPlus
- **Manhwa** → Webtoon, TappyToon
- **Manhua** → Bilibili Comics, MangaToon

This fragmentation means:
- Managing **multiple accounts** and subscriptions
- **Inconsistent reading experiences** across apps
- No **unified library** or reading history
- Missing out on **cross-format discovery** ("If you liked this manga, try this novel")

**BookVill solves this by being the single destination for all reading formats — one account, one library, one reader.**
